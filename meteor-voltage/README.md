## Voltage

This Meteor package provides easy, editable, static pages. Perfect for your `About`,
`Terms Of Service`, and `Contact Us` pages. `voltage` is _not_ (currently) a CMS.
It's an easy way for a developer to maintain static pages, as opposed to an end
user.

Example project: http://voltage-example.meteor.com
